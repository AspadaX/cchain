Here’s a revised version of your README that incorporates the promotional arguments and improves clarity and structure:

# cchain

## Overview
`cchain` is a **modern CLI automation tool** built in Rust that allows you to chain commands together in a structured, retry-aware workflow. Define your automation pipelines in JSON, and let `cchain` handle execution, error recovery, and dynamic input generation using language models (LLMs). Whether you're automating local development tasks, CI/CD pipelines, or complex workflows, `cchain` is designed to replace brittle shell scripts with a **declarative, developer-friendly approach**.

---

## Features
- **Command Chaining**: Execute a series of commands with configurable arguments, retries, and environment variables.
- **Retry Logic**: Automatically retry failed commands with a specified number of attempts.
- **Dynamic Input Generation**: Use LLMs to generate command inputs dynamically (e.g., AI-generated commit messages).
- **Environment Variable Management**: Override environment variables per-command and pass outputs between steps.
- **Interpreter Agnostic**: Run commands in `sh`, `bash`, or any interpreter of your choice.
- **Bookmarking**: Save frequently used command chains for quick access.
- **Lightweight & Fast**: Built in Rust for performance and reliability—no startup lag or dependency hell.

---

## Why `cchain`?
- **Replace Bash Scripts**: Stop debugging flaky shell scripts. Define workflows in JSON for version control, reusability, and auditability.
- **AI-Powered Automation**: Integrate LLMs into your workflows—generate commit messages, summarize logs, or categorize outputs on the fly.
- **Local & CI Consistency**: Test pipeline steps locally before pushing to CI. Ensure identical behavior across environments.
- **Cross-Platform**: Single binary deployment works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Installation

### Cargo
Install `cchain` using Cargo:
```sh
cargo install cchain
```

### Building from Source
Clone the repository and build it using Cargo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/aspadax/cchain.git
cd cchain
cargo build --release
```

---

## Usage

### Basic Example
Create a JSON configuration file to define your command chain. For example:
```json
[
    {
        "command": "echo",
        "arguments": ["Hello, world!"],
        "retry": 3
    },
    {
        "command": "ls",
        "arguments": ["-la"],
        "retry": 1
    }
]
```

Run `cchain` with the configuration file:
```sh
cchain -c path/to/configuration.json
```

### Environment Variables
Override environment variables per-command and capture command outputs for reuse:
```json
[
    {
        "command": "echo",
        "arguments": ["$<<env_var_name>>"],
        "environment_variables_override": {
            "hello": "world"
        },
        "stdout_stored_to": "<<env_var_output>>",
        "interpreter": "sh",
        "retry": 0
    },
    {
        "command": "echo",
        "arguments": ["$<<env_var_output>>"],
        "retry": 0
    }
]
```

### AI-Powered Workflows
Use LLMs to generate dynamic inputs. For example, generate a commit message based on `git diff`:
```json
[
    {
        "command": "git",
        "arguments": ["commit", "-m", "llm_generate('generate a commit message', 'git --no-pager diff')"],
        "retry": 1
    }
]
```

Configure your LLM by setting these environment variables:
```sh
export CCHAIN_OPENAI_API_BASE="http://localhost:11434/v1"
export CCHAIN_OPENAI_API_KEY="test_api_key"
export CCHAIN_OPENAI_MODEL="mistral"
```

### Bookmarking
Bookmark frequently used command chains for quick access:
```sh
cchain -c path/to/configuration.json -b
```

Delete a bookmark:
```sh
cchain -r
```

## Example Use Cases
- **Git Automation**: Automate `git add`, `git commit` (with AI-generated messages), and `git push` in one workflow.
- **CI/CD Prep**: Run linters, build artifacts, and generate changelogs locally before pushing to CI.
- **Onboarding**: Set up dev environments with a single command—clone repos, install dependencies, and configure tools.
- **AI-Augmented Debugging**: Use LLMs to analyze logs, categorize errors, or suggest fixes.
